CTFs are gamified competitive cybersecurity events that are based on different challenges or aspects of information security. They are excellent for both beginners and experienced hackers looking to develop, test, and prove their skills because they gamify hacking concepts.

For example, Web, Forensic, Crypto, Binary or something else. Team can gain some points for every solved task. More points for more complicated tasks usually. 

The next task in chain can be opened only after some team solve previous task. Then the game time is over sum of points shows you a CTF winner.

Capture The Flag events can be exciting (and sometimes frustrating) but always rewarding.
