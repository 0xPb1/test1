### Introduction 

This challenge is set in a scenario where a Microsoft employee accidentally exposed their login credentials on the "shield portal." Your task is to find these exposed credentials within the JavaScript files and follow the flag format.

## Solution:

1. **Initial Visit:** Start by visiting the "shield portal" at [shield.growwinfra.in](https://shield.growwinfra.in/).
    
2.  **Inspect JavaScript Files:** Right-click on the webpage and select "Inspect" or use the browser's developer tools to examine the source code, especially the JavaScript files.
	
3. **Locate and Open JavaScript File:** The challenge provides you with a specific JavaScript file to investigate: [connect.js](https://shield.growwinfra.in/static/external/connect.js). This file is where the exposed credentials are hidden.
    
4. **Flag Discovery:** Your mission is to find the username and password within the JavaScript code. Search for comments or variables that might contain these credentials.
    
5. **Extract the Flag:** When you discover the exposed username and password, note them down in the correct flag format: `GCTF{4dm1n:nWaWlpkC8cArTLUM}`.

## Flag:

`GCTF{4dm1n:nWaWlpkC8cArTLUM}`
