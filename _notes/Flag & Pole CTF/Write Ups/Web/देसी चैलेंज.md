### Introduction:

Welcome to the **"देसी चैलेंज**" CTF challenge! Your task is to bypass a captcha and find the correct number between 1000 and 7000. Once you enter the correct number, you will receive a pastebin link containing the flag. The challenge highlights the significance of implementing rate limiting and captcha mechanisms to protect systems from abuse.

## Solution:

1. **Initial Visit:** Start by visiting the provided URL: [http://10.209.0.143:9002/captcha1/](http://10.209.0.143:9002/captcha1/).
    
2. **Captcha Challenge:** You'll encounter a captcha challenge that requires entering the correct number between 1000 and 7000.
    
3. **Rate Limiting and Captcha:** Before attempting to brute force the number, it's important to understand the underlying security mechanisms like rate limiting and captcha. In real-world scenarios, these mechanisms are implemented to prevent automated or abusive actions on websites.
	
	In a scenario where the captcha field can be bypassed by omitting it from the request, you can streamline the brute force script by not including the captcha parameter in the POST request. Here's how you can modify the solution:

 4. **Script Development:**
    
    - Develop a script using a programming language like Python to systematically test numbers between 1000 and 7000.
    - Use the `requests` library to send POST requests to the URL without including the captcha parameter.
5. **Brute Force:**
    
    - In the script, iterate through the numbers between 1000 and 7000, and for each number, send a POST request to the URL.
    - The script should not include the captcha parameter in the request.
6. **Flag Extraction:**
    
    - Once you find the correct number and bypass the captcha, you will receive the pastebin link containing the flag.
    - Retrieve the flag hidden within the pastebin link. The flag appears as an unusually long encoded string, and once decoded, it should be structured as `GCTF{y0u_must_enforce_r4t3_l1m1t1ng_h3r3}`.

## Flag:

The flag should be in the format `GCTF{y0u_must_enforce_r4t3_l1m1t1ng_h3r3}`.

Congratulations! You've successfully completed the "**देसी चैलेंज**" challenge by bypassing the captcha, finding the correct number, and receiving the paste bin link containing the flag. This challenge demonstrates the importance of implementing security measures like rate limiting and captchas to protect web applications from abuse and exploitation.
