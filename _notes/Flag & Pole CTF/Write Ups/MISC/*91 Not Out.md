Description:

Welcome to the "*91 Not Out*" CTF challenge! You are presented with a seemingly gibberish string, but the challenge title and description provide hints about a connection to the number 91. Your mission is to decode the provided string, revealing the hidden flag.

**Challenge String:**

	```UJm0#{1X{zVs`8:Ms}K.{^kMX$G;S9P```

## Solution:

1. **Understanding Base91 Encoding:**
    
    - Base91 is a binary-to-text encoding scheme that uses 91 printable ASCII characters. It is similar to Base64 encoding but includes more characters, which means it can represent binary data more efficiently.
    - To solve this challenge, you need to decode the given Base91-encoded string.
    
2. **Decoding the String:**
    
    - You can use various methods to decode Base91, including programming languages or online tools.
    - Below is an online base91 decoder

3. **Flag Extraction:**

- Give the encoded string to the base91 decoder and it will decode the Base91 string, revealing the flag.
- The flag should be in the format `GCTF{1t's_ju$t_4_w4rm_up}`.

## Flag:

The flag is in the format `GCTF{1t's_ju$t_4_w4rm_up}`.

Congratulations! You've successfully completed the "*91 Not Out*" challenge by decoding the Base91-encoded string and revealing the hidden flag. This challenge demonstrates the importance of recognizing and understanding different encoding schemes.
