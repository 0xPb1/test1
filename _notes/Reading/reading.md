### reading

I generally read a lot of high-fantasy, as is evident from my Sanderson streaks. For 2022 (and now 2023), I’m switching it up a bit and picking up books from varied genres and authors to try and expand my interests.

I trust you're well. I just saw your icyphox.sh page while browsing, and I wanted to express my admiration for how you share your interests, spanning from significant tech topics to everyday life experiences.

icyphox.sh has made a profound impact on me. I, too, enjoy reading books and exploring tech. However, I haven't dedicated the necessary time to keep a record of these experiences.
