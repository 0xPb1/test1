# eLFI already solved it, better get going #BUGCROWD Challenge

The Bugcrowd has thrown down the gauntlet to all hackers out there.

**HINT-1**: "I am eLFI."

1. First, I visited this link: [Bugcrowd Advent Challenge](https://bugcrowd-advent-challenge.herokuapp.com/login.php).

2. I attempted to log in with `user1` and `Randompassword123` as credentials, which resulted in an internal server error, as shown below:

3. I tinkered with the `login.php` page, but no luck.

4. I delved into the source code of `login.php` and found a few interesting lines that caught my attention, as highlighted below:

5. I remembered the hint, and these lines of code seemed related.

6. This led me to discover a vulnerable endpoint: `/style.php?css_file=custom.css`.

7. It appeared to filter out `/etc/passwd`, so I attempted URL and BASE64 encoding, but no luck.

8. After some more exploration, I noticed another file: `index.php`.

9. When I tried to open it, it redirected me to `login.php`. However, in the network tab, I saw `index.php` with a status code of 302.

10. I felt suspicious about `index.php` and decided to investigate further.

11. I used `php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=<filename>` to bypass restrictions and view the source code of `index.php`.

12. `index.php` revealed an encoded string, which I decoded using CyberChef.

13. After decoding, I found another PHP file: `dashboard.php`. I replaced `index.php` with `dashboard.php`.

14. `dashboard.php` presented another encoded string, which I decoded again.

15. After decoding, I found yet another file: `sober.php`.

16. I replaced `dashboard.php` with `sober.php` and discovered another encoded string in the comments, although smaller than the earlier ones.

17. After decoding, I obtained the following code: **FLAG{d1g_d33p_and_find_7he_power_within}**.

I don't know why, but I was drawn to this challenge and even took some time off work to solve it. Thanks to [Bugcrowd](https://twitter.com/Bugcrowd) for the fun challenge!

The challenge might seem simple after reading this walkthrough, but believe me, it took a lot of brainpower and time to execute.
