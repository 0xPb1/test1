# Prasanth Bodepu

Hi, I'm [Prasanth Bodepu](https://0xpb1.app/resume), a 22-year-old security researcher with a focus on cybersecurity. Currently, I work as a Product Security Engineer at [Groww](https://groww.in) in Bengaluru.

## About Me

In my professional life, I am dedicated to enhancing product security and ensuring the safety of digital systems. I have a love-hate relationship with the mind-boggling challenges and puzzle-solving fun of the cybersecurity field. It's like a rollercoaster ride with no seatbelts! 🎢💻😅

During my free time, I love participating in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions, where I can put my skills to the test and learn new techniques. I also enjoy creating vulnerable CTF applications and boxes for others to explore and learn from.
